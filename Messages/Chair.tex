	It is a great pleasure to send this message as the Dean of the Faculty of Information Technology for the International Research Symposium 2024 at the University of Vocational Technology on the theme “Vocational Technology Education for a Sustainable Greener Economy”
    
This event has become a significant occasion for the University, as the dissemination of knowledge is a fundamental responsibility of academics. I encourage our students to demonstrate dedication and commitment in publishing your academic work for achieving your professional goals. As we stand at the forefront of the technological revolution, I am filled with immense pride and anticipation for the challenging yet exciting event which leads the university to up-lift to a higher rank.

As we all know organizing this kind of event on annual basis is not an easy task. I wish to congratulate the organizers of the Symposium for their determined effort.

I firmly believe that this Symposium will bring a productive output in terms of academic and students research work. I express my special thanks to the symposium organizing committee, all participants and the presenters.
Best wishes for a successful and inspiring symposium.
